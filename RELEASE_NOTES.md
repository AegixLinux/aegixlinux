# RELEASE NOTES

## Full Moon Release 1 - Centrifugal Bumblepuppy

Branch name: `release/centrifugal_bumblepuppy` 

---

The term **"centrifugal bumblepuppy"** comes from Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World." It refers to a complicated, machine-based game played by children in the novel's dystopian society. Here's what it represents:

- **Meaningless Complexity:** The game involves intricate equipment and serves no real purpose other than entertainment. It exemplifies how society invests time and resources into trivial pursuits.
- **Promotion of Consumption:** By designing games that require expensive machinery, the society encourages continuous consumption, fueling the economy while keeping citizens distracted.
- **Distraction from Substance:** The game symbolizes how superficial activities replace meaningful experiences, diverting attention from critical thought or genuine human connection.
