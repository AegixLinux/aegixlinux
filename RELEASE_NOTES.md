The term **"centrifugal bumblepuppy"** comes from Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*. It refers to a complicated, machine-based game played by children in the novel's dystopian society. Here's what it represents:

- **Meaningless Complexity**: The game involves intricate equipment and serves no real purpose other than entertainment. It exemplifies how society invests time and resources into trivial pursuits.
- **Promotion of Consumption**: By designing games that require expensive machinery, the society encourages continuous consumption, fueling the economy while keeping citizens distracted.
- **Distraction from Substance**: The game symbolizes how superficial activities replace meaningful experiences, diverting attention from critical thought or genuine human connection.

With this release, we aim to cut through meaningless complexity, offering simple, powerful tools that help users stay focused on what matters.
